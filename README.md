# Hi there! 👋

My name is Philip and I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a software engineer that enjoys crafting cool mobile and web applications that targets a wide array of audiences. That is, everyone! My interest in software engineering first developed back when I was in middle school. At the time, the first iPhone was just introduced, and while my parents couldn’t afford to get me one, they did get me an iPod Touch for my birthday. Or rather I begged for it, but that’s beside the point. Though at the time, I didn’t know that I wanted to pursue software engineering as a career, the seed was already planted. It was the coolest device that I thought existed. There were a plethora of apps from the App Store. There were apps ranging from gaming to music to utilities. Endless amount of possibilities in such a small compact device. I thought it was magic. At the time, I thought to myself “How cool would it be to create an app one day?” Fast forward to 2022, I have a portfolio of apps that I’ve created to showcase.
